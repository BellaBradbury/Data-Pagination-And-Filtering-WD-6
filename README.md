# MOCK STUDENT DATABASE


---APP OVERVIEW---

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This app displays a mock student database using static data. A user can find students by either utilizing the pagination buttons at the bottom of the page or via the search bar at the top of the page. A search is case insensitive and works with partial matches.

</br>

---HELP---
  - **Search Feature** - Search is case insensitive and works with partial matches. 
  - **'Search' input field** - Allows a string of characters to be typed which will then be checked against the database. After typing in the *Search input*, press enter or the *Search button* to have matched students display on the page. 
  - **'Send Search' (*magnifying glass icon*) button** - Displays any students that match the string entered in the *Search input* onto the page. If no students match the search, the page will read 'There are no profiles matching your search.'.
  - **'Clear Search' (*'X' icon*) button** - Resets 'Search' input field and displays all students.
  - **'Page' (*numbered at bottom of page*) buttons** - Displays appropriate students corresponding to the page number. Ex. *Page button* '1' displays students 1-9, *Page button* '2' displays students 10-19, and so on.
